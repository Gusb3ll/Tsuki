## Place pretrained models here. 

We provide two pretrained models:

1. `RRDB_ESRGAN_x4.pth`: the final ESRGAN model we used in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219). 
2. `RRDB_PSNR_x4.pth`: the PSNR-oriented model with **high PSNR performance**.

*Note that* the pretrained models are trained under the `MATLAB bicubic` kernel. 
If the downsampled kernel is different from that, the results may have artifacts.
